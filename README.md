- An administrator panel for inventory management.
- Fast and responsive design to support seamless user experience.


## Target Audience

The primary audience for the **Livraria Online** includes:
- Individuals with a passion for reading across various genres.
- Customers aged between 15-40 years who typically shop online.
- Researchers and students looking for academic resources.



## Key Features

### For Users:
- Search and filter books by genre, price, or section.
- Browse a wide variety of books with ease.
- User-friendly and interactive website design.
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop users.

### For Administrators:
- Manage book inventory (add, update, delete books).
- View orders and manage customer requests.
- Analytics and reports on inventory and sales.

### System-Level Features:
- Secure payment and checkout process.
- Custom book recommendations.
- Scalable architecture with high availability.



## Tech Stack

The development of this project will utilize the following technologies:

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI/UX.
  - Responsive Design (CSS frameworks like Bootstrap).
  
- **Backend:**
  - **PHP** for server-side logic.
  - **Java** for microservices.
  - **Python** for data processing and AI-based features.
  - **JavaScript** for interactive elements.

- **Database:**
  - **MySQL** for relational data.
  - **MongoDB** for NoSQL data (user sessions, recommendations).

- **Containers & Orchestration:**
  - **Docker** for containerized services.
  - **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.


## Security Measures

Ensuring a secure environment is crucial, especially for e-commerce applications handling sensitive data like payment information. Below are the key security measures implemented:

### 2.1 Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for both customers and administrators.
- **OAuth2 / JWT** for secure session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities.

### 2.2 Data Protection
- **TLS/SSL Encryption** for all data transmissions.
- Passwords are stored using secure hashing algorithms like **bcrypt** or **PBKDF2**.
- Sensitive data such as payment information is protected using encryption protocols.

### 2.3 Protection Against Attacks
- Implement protections against **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, and **CSRF**.
- Regular security audits through **penetration testing** and **vulnerability analysis**.
- Use of **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** to monitor for suspicious activity.



## Distributed Systems Architecture

To ensure scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance, **Livraria Online** employs a distributed architecture.

### 3.1 Microservices Architecture
- The system is divided into independent microservices, each responsible for a specific function (e.g., user management, payment processing, book inventory management).
- Each service can be scaled individually and deployed in **containers** using **Docker**.

### 3.2 Distributed Databases
- **SQL** for structured data (e.g., book catalog).
- **NoSQL (MongoDB)** for unstructured data (e.g., user sessions).
- **Replication** and **Sharding** ensure the database remains available and scalable.

### 3.3 Messaging and Task Queues
- **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** is used for inter-service communication.
- **Celery** is used to offload long-running tasks, such as sending confirmation emails or processing large orders, to background workers.

### 3.4 Load Balancing & High Availability
- Load balancers distribute the traffic across multiple servers.
- **Failover mechanisms** are in place to ensure that, if one server goes down, another takes over.



## Engineering Practices

### 4.1 Agile Methodologies
- Use of **Scrum** or **Kanban** to manage the development process.
- Tools like **JIRA** or **Trello** help track progress and manage tasks.

### 4.2 Design Patterns
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to separate concerns.
- **Repository Pattern** for data persistence and **Adapter Pattern** for integration with external services.

### 4.3 Automated Testing
- **Unit Testing**, **Integration Testing**, and **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** are implemented to ensure software quality.
- **JUnit**, **Selenium**, and **Cypress** are used for automating tests.

### 4.4 CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
- **CI/CD pipelines** automate code integration, testing, and deployment to ensure rapid and reliable updates.



## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features

### 5.1 Personalized Book Recommendations
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggest books based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend books based on user activity and book attributes.
- **Hybrid Systems**: A combination of both methods for more accurate recommendations.
- AI Models are built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, or **PyTorch**.

### 5.2 Chatbots for Personalized Assistance
- Use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to build chatbots that can assist users with book recommendations, order tracking, and customer support.
- Platforms like **Dialogflow** or **Rasa** are used for chatbot integration.

### 5.3 Automated Book Descriptions
- **GPT-4** or other language models generate book descriptions based on metadata and user input.

### 5.4 Image Processing for Book Classification
- **Computer Vision** models (built with **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, or **Amazon Rekognition**) to classify books based on cover images.
